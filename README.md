# Flappy Bird Clone
This repository is a clone of the famous game flappy bird.
I made this with acadamic propouses.

## Technologies
This game was made using unity.

## About the project
This project was made watching the Game Maker's Toolkit [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) for beginners.

### Challenges
In addition to the tutorial I've implemented some of the propoused challenges like the animations for the wing and the game over message if the bird goes of the screen.
